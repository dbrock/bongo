;;; To do:

;; Shuffle operations.  It would be nice to have both a
;; random shuffle operation and an interleaving
;; enqueue operation.

;; Sorting operations.

;; Implement `bongo-file-name-roots' so that forcer can try
;; out Bongo. :-)

;; Customizing `bongo-header-line-mode' should have
;; immediate effect on existing Bongo playlist buffers.

;; Implement scrolling for the header line.

;; Better error messages when players fail.

;; Generalize intra-playlist queue.

;; Implement intra-track region repeat.

;; Provide a way to specify that intermediate headers
;; (cf. `bongo-insert-intermediate-headers') should be
;; inserted even for singleton albums.

;; Implement support for crossfading.

;; Optimize `bongo-line-get-property' as much as possible,
;; as it is called lots of times all over the place.

;;;; Markings

;;; Each track line in Bongo is either marked or unmarked.
;;; The set of marked track lines is called the `marking'.
;;; Many commands default to operating on the marked track
;;; lines whenever the buffer has at least one.
;;;
;;; Marked track lines have non-nil `bongo-marked' properties,
;;; and the values of their `bongo-reference-counted-marker'
;;; properties appear in `bongo-marking', which is a list of
;;; pairs (MARKER . REFERENCE-COUNT) such that each MARKER
;;; points either nowhere (in which case the track line to
;;; which it refers is currently unavailable --- for example,
;;; it may be killed), or to the start of a marked track line.
;;;
;;; The `bongo-marking' list facilitates quickly walking
;;; over all marked track lines, but the double bookkeeping
;;; increases complexity.  (Remember to update both the text
;;; property and the global list.)
;;;
;;; Contrary to earlier versions, marks on killed tracks do
;;; persist when yanking the tracks back, provided that the
;;; same marking is still in effect in the buffer.
;;;
;;; There is another list `bongo-killed-marking', which does
;;; not necessarily hold markers pointing to currently marked
;;; track lines; instead, it stores an inactive marking that
;;; can be restored at a later time.  Most commands operating
;;; on the marked tracks kill the current marking afterwards.
;;;
;;; [In the future, this feature may be extended to a stack.]

This mode can only be enabled in Bongo playlist buffers.
When it is enabled, Bongo automatically adds random tracks

In Bongo Sprinkle mode, whenever a track is played or one or
more unplayed tracks are killed, Bongo appends enough random
tracks to the playlist to ensure that `bongo-sprinkle-amount'
unplayed tracks are present at any time.\\<bongo-mode-map>

To move unplayed tracks around without causing any sprinkling,
use the `\\[bongo-transpose-forward]' and \

To manually sprinkle the buffer, use the `\\[bongo-sprinkle]' command.
For example, `5 \\[bongo-sprinkle]' will append five random tracks,

will append 16 random tracks.
